This seal design was used on official documents and letterheads from 1868 - 1939. In 1939 a bill was approved by the Alabama Legislature and Governor Frank M. Dixon to restore the original seal.",

Today's seal contains rays above the mountains that represent the famous Alaskan northern lights. The smelter symbolizes mining; the train stands for Alaska's railroads; and ships denote transportation by sea. The trees pictured in the seal symbolize the state's wealth of timber, and the farmer, his horse, and the three shocks of wheat stand for Alaskan agriculture.
